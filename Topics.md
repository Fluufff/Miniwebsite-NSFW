## Topics

Here is a general description of the different topics:
- #General: a vanilla landing chat where vanilla topics and pictures can be shared (tasteful nudities, hook up discussions, places to be, etc). If there is any doubt if the subject is vanilla, look at the other topics or ask a @moderator.
- #NSFW stores around the convention: to talk about the local shops (local sexshops love us) where to find gear, safe sex protection, and so on.
- #Yiff Posting: a topic where to share pictures about the artists you love (bonus point if they’re going to be at Flüüfff) and your sonas getting in frisky situations.
Do not spam with pictures, do not forget to credit the artists.
- #Puppies: bark bark bark! And pet play.
- #Bondage: bondage practices like shibari, dominance-play… The chat is not intended for Hard practices (please contact a moderator if you’d like to see such topic).
- #Murrsuiting: let’s get out in and out there! Share your best murrsuit pictures, sessions and advices.
